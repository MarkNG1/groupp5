# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Quick Steps to Make Your Site Public

### 1. Prepare for Static Hosting
Since GitHub Pages doesn't support PHP, we'll use the static data version:

1. **Backup your PHP files** (keep them for future hosting)
2. **Update app.js** to use static data as fallback
3. **Push to GitHub**
4. **Enable GitHub Pages**

### 2. Commands to Run

```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Ready for GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Pages
3. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
4. Branch: "main"
5. Folder: "/ (root)"
6. Save

### 4. Your Site Will Be Live At:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/muranga-properties/
```

### 5. Share This URL
Anyone in the world can access your site using this URL!

## Features That Will Work:
- ✅ Property browsing and filtering
- ✅ Interactive map
- ✅ Property details modal
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Host dashboard UI
- ❌ Database functionality (bookings, adding properties)

## Note for Viewers:
Add this note to your README: "This is a demo version showcasing the frontend. Full database functionality available in the PHP version."
