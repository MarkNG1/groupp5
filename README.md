## Known Bugs (Working on These!)

- Sometimes the map doesn't load on slow connections
- Mobile modal scrolling is a bit wonky on some phones
- Need to add image upload - currently just using URLs
- Booking confirmation emails don't work yet
- The search could be faster with more properties

## What I Want to Add Next

- Email notifications (still figuring out how to do this)
- Payment system (maybe M-Pesa integration?)
- Better search features
- User login system
- Maybe a mobile app later
- Swahili language support for local users
